##Descriptions
function.js
We declare a constant variable 'score' to assign a value '20'.
We declare a variable called grade that will be used to store grade value.
We then use 'if' statement to compare the score to different thresholds.
Finally, we enter the grade and score into the console.

index.js
We declare a function variable 'calculateDemeritPoints' that contains speed as a parameter.
We then assign different variables called speedLimit, kmPerDemeritPoint and intialPoints which are assigned values as 70, 5 and 0 respectively.
We use the if statement to compare the speed against speedlimit and if they are equal it should return "OK' to show driver is driving within speedLimit.
We use the 'else' statement to calculate the demeritPoint if speed is greater than speedLimit and then we print the total demerit points.
